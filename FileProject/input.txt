A court in Florence has reconvicted Amanda Knox for slander, years after she was acquitted of murdering her British roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007.
Knox will not go to prison as she has already served four years for the murder, for which she was originally convicted.
At the time she was also convicted of slander for blaming the murder on local bar owner Patrick Lumumba during police interrogation, but that conviction was quashed last year and a retrial ordered.
Knox's lawyers have said they expect to appeal against the latest verdict.
They added that Amanda was disappointed as she was hoping to finally clear her name after years of legal battles.
She told the court on Wednesday that police had coerced her into implicating Mr Lumumba.
"The police threatened me with 30 years in prison, an officer slapped me three times saying 'Remember, remember'," Knox, 36, said.
"I'm very sorry that I wasn't strong enough to withstand the pressure from the police," she added, speaking in Italian.
"I never wanted to slander Patrick. He was my friend, he took care of me and consoled me for the loss of my friend (Meredith). I'm sorry I wasn't able to resist the pressure and that he suffered."
Mr Lumumba was arrested in connection with the 2007 murder and spent two weeks behind bars, but was released without charge after a customer gave him an alibi.
Despite this, his lawyers said the case has affected his reputation, and that he “became known everywhere as the monster of Perugia”.
His lawyer told reporters outside the courthouse before the hearing: "He lost his job, had his bar seized for months, and had to return to Poland, because his wife was Polish.”
Mr Lumumba was not in court.
